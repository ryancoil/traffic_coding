## (1) Loading required libraries. First time user would need to install these libraries before loading them.

library("googleAuthR")

library("googleAnalyticsR")

library("dplyr")

library(lubridate)

library("RODBC")

library(readxl)

library(stringr)


## Authenticating 

ga_auth() 
view_id <- XXXXXXXXX

## (2) getting the dates right 

SOM <- Sys.Date()-1
EOM <- SOM

## (3) pulling in sessions/traffic data from google analytics 

GA_Traffic <- google_analytics(view_id,
                                         
                                         date_range = c(SOM,EOM),
                                         
                                         dimensions = c("date","deviceCategory"),
                                         
                                         metrics = c("transactionRevenue","itemQuantity","transactions","exits","users"),
                                         
                                         anti_sample = TRUE)

## (4) Data transformation : changing the column names
colnames(GA_Traffic)[1:5] <- c("Date","Device","Revenue","Units","transactions")

## (5) Data transformation
a <- paste0("'",GA_Traffic$Device,"' ,'",GA_Traffic$Date,"' ,",GA_Traffic$Revenue," ,",GA_Traffic$Units," ,",GA_Traffic$transactions," ,",GA_Traffic$exits," ,",GA_Traffic$users)
GA_Traffic <- GA_Traffic %>% mutate()
b <- paste0("insert into [ha_report].[dbo].[tbl_Direct_Sales] ([DirectSaletype],[Date],[Sales] ,[Units],[Orders],[Visits],[UniqueVisitors]) values (",a,")")
append_values <- paste(b, collapse = " ")

## (6) Appending the transformed data to exisiting SQL database table
  
   ## Create a User DSN named 'Datamart1' . This DSN for sql server driver needs to be created with database set to master before running this code. 
  mycon1 <-odbcConnect("Datamart1", uid="Merilytics", pwd="*******")
  
   # Drop values if already existing 
  drop_value <-  paste0("between"," '",SOM,"' ","and"," '",EOM,"'")
  Dropping_rows <- sqlQuery(mycon1,paste0("DELETE FROM [ha_report].[dbo].[tbl_Direct_Sales] WHERE date ",drop_value,""))
  
   # Updating table
  Adding_rows <- sqlQuery(mycon1,append_values)
  
  rm("mycon1")
